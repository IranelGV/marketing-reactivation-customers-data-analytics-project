Project analyzing how HelloFresh can better reactivate inactive customers by measuring incremental lift, comparing channel efficiency, and identifying opportunities to reduce churn and improve KPIs. Includes insights, SQL snippets, and testing recommendations.

## Marketing (Reactivation) Data Analictic Project
HelloFresh wants to reactivate inactive customers (former subscribers) by maximizing incremental lift and channel efficiency (Email, Push, Paid Social, Paid Search) while optimizing marketing spend. They aim to understand:

How well customers are reactivated globally,
Which channels are the most efficient,
Where the levers are to reduce churn impact and improve business KPIs.

Objective of the analysis:

Measure and explain reactivation performance globally and by channel/market.
Identify opportunities and quick wins.
Propose reporting improvements and tests to capture incremental uplift and standardize processes.

Deliverables:

A 10–12 slide deck with insights and recommendations.
1–2 key SQL queries (or snippets) and a dashboard outline.
(Optional) A brief A/B testing plan and a churn/reactivation propensity model.
